Even though homes are not the same across the globe, human computer interaction (HCI) research on smart home technologies overwhelmingly take place in western societies. In this talk, Hope will present his work focusing on using smart home technologies to support domestic activities in the Global South, specifically in some part of sub-Saharan Africa. Generally, his findings suggest that people in the Global South are interested to use sensor-based technologies, and they quickly find different ways of appropriating them to suit their needs. Hope will focus on the unexpected ways people use these technologies and their reflections on using them to support domestic activities. He will conclude his presentation with a discussion about the unintended consequences which accompany the deployment of smart home technologies in the Global South. Hopes’ work presents opportunities for designing smart home technologies to support people’s needs beyond western societies. Further, his work expands on existing discussion about smart home technologies by considering marginalized perspectives on how they can be used in the home.","tags":[],"title":"Using Smart Home Technologies to Support Domestic Activities in the Global South","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Resources for Attendees\nhttps://www.susanwyche.com/ Seminar Details\nZoom: https://washington.zoom.us/j/93100061611 Presenter Bio Susan Wyche is an Associate Professor in the Department of Media and Information at Michigan State University and has a courtesy appointment in MSU’s African Studies Center.

However, few—if any—of these projects reach their potential. Given that most of these projects fail researchers and practitioners might consider adopting different approaches to design. In this talk, I will offer “irrational design” as an alternative to human-centered design. This approach draws from 15+ years of studying technology use in sub-Saharan Africa, in (primarily Kenyan) sites, as well as my training as an industrial designer. In particular, I will present three case studies detailing my use of these design methods in research conducted in rural Kenya: cultural probes, speculative design, and design workbooks. My findings raise questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the pursuit of a single solution in design. These findings also draw attention to different ways for people to participate in design processes, and to the value of long-term engagement with communities.","tags":[],"title":"Reimagining Human-Centered Design: Considering Reflexivity, Speculation and Long-term Engagement in ICTD","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Resources for Attendees\nSeminar Details\nZoom: https://washington.zoom.us/j/93100061611 Presenter Bio Rob Johnson, 31 started his professional life as an electrical engineer for New York’s MTA and has gradually found his way into the world of public policy and broadband.
