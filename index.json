Due to the sensitivity of HIV-related information, eHealth applications in HIV care necessitate the attention and prioritization of data security and privacy. We explored diverse stakeholders’ views on data security and privacy in Malawi’s public HIV care program to expand the understanding of gaps and opportunities in improving data protections. This work connects data security and privacy goals and practices with previous work on mobile device usage as well as global best practices for security and privacy in healthcare settings. A key finding articulated by stakeholders is the importance of establishing strong data security governance.","tags":[],"title":"eHealth Data Security and Privacy of HIV Care in Malawi","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Talk Recorded: Yes (Link to recording)\nResources for Attendees\nSeminar Details\nZoom: https://washington.zoom.us/j/95254816636 Presenter Bio Richard Anderson is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, where he has been on the faculty since 1986, with brief leaves to Indian Institute of Science, Microsoft Research, and PATH.

Further, they face structural barriers to securing legal access to the electricity grid. This has created a complex informal electricity resale market of unmetered connections controlled by landlords and informal electricians, providing a marginal level of grid access and engendering new vulnerabilities. Illegally tapping into nearby distribution infrastructure results in numerous fatalities from electrocution, leaves households vulnerable to exploitation by intermediaries, costs utilities millions of dollars annually, and destabilizes the local power grid. In this talk, I will present some early findings from remote monitoring of power quality and reliability conducted in 25 informal settlements in Kampala by Spotlight Kampala – a research initiative aiming to offer actionable insight into access challenges in informal communities Kampala.

Even though homes are not the same across the globe, human computer interaction (HCI) research on smart home technologies overwhelmingly take place in western societies. In this talk, Hope will present his work focusing on using smart home technologies to support domestic activities in the Global South, specifically in some part of sub-Saharan Africa. Generally, his findings suggest that people in the Global South are interested to use sensor-based technologies, and they quickly find different ways of appropriating them to suit their needs. Hope will focus on the unexpected ways people use these technologies and their reflections on using them to support domestic activities. He will conclude his presentation with a discussion about the unintended consequences which accompany the deployment of smart home technologies in the Global South. Hopes’ work presents opportunities for designing smart home technologies to support people’s needs beyond western societies.

In this talk, I will offer “irrational design” as an alternative to human-centered design. This approach draws from 15+ years of studying technology use in sub-Saharan Africa, in (primarily Kenyan) sites, as well as my training as an industrial designer. In particular, I will present three case studies detailing my use of these design methods in research conducted in rural Kenya: cultural probes, speculative design, and design workbooks.
